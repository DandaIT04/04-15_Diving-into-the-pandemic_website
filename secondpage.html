        it is reported that there are around 81 MILLION cases of people<br>
        infected with covid-19 so far as of 2nd of february 2021. With the
        total deaths amounting to around 1.7 million,<br> it is crucial that
        we are not complacent regarding the current situation of the epidemic
        and to stay indoors as much as possible to avoid being exposed to
        the virus.<br> This website aims to not just inform but educate the masses
        regarding Covid-19, the possible origins, how it spreads, how it is being
        treated, how to prevent and so on!
