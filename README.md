!!! For Lecturers !!!
We will be using live share extension so commits may only include a single commit
but we are working together

Purpose is to integrate API into a website. Lottie as loading. Trivia as game.

- Our website upon loading will have lottie

- After loading completes, it will load information about
the number of cases of covid19 in singapore, whatever
the api provides.
- Need a good background for this.
- Then a learn more button will be at the bottom. Taking
us to a new html page with summarized information regarding
covid-19. What caused it, what caused the spread, new strains,
ways to prevent it, importance of preventing it.

Option 1
- Then at the bottom will have "Take the quiz"
- We give 10 questions about the info in new html
- Use RestDB to store score and name into db and display scoreboars
