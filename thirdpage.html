        <p>Unfortunately, it is unknown when the case started. However, around 2019 of

        <p>It was speculated that the virus first originated on 1st of October 2019, even though 
          the earliest known case was on 1st of December 2019. Covid-19 is known to come from the
          wet market of Wuhan China. Scientist think that the coronavirus came from bats.

            <p>According to the article written by the World Health Organisation, transmission happens
              when an individual comes in direct contact with someone who is infected via respiratory
              droplets, normally through coughing and sneezing. A person can also be infected if they
              have touched contaminated surfaces that contain the virus and happen to accidentally put
              their hands on their eyes,mouth etc. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 Virus can survive for
              several hours on surfaces but can easily get obliterated by disinfectants.

        <p> For serious cases where patients are in critical condition, doctors in the United Kingdom have
          administered a type of steroid, which according to them, provided benefits which increased their 
          survivability, however does not prove to help in the patient's recovery. Also, studies regarding administering 
          steroids were conflicting. Fortunately, there are a few vaccines available such as the  Pfizer-BioNTech 
          COVID-19 vaccine.
